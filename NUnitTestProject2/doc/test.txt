You’ve now got a local git repository. You can use git locally, like that, if you want. But if you want the thing to have a home on github, do the following.

Go to github.
Log in to your account.
Click the new repository button in the top-right. You’ll have an option there to initialize the repository with a README file, but I don’t.
Click the “Create repository” button.
